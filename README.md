# Deep-Learning-Detection-Of-Alzheimers
The aim of this project is to create an accurate model that is able to predict 4 stages of Alzheimers using a neuroimaging dataset acquired from Kaggle. 
Please refer to the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Khalizo/Deep-Learning-Detection-Of-Alzheimers/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Detection%20of%204%20Stages%20of%20Alzheimer's%20Progression.ipynb) for more information on this project.
